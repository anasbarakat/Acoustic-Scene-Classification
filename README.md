# Acoustic-Scene-Classification
June 2017
Contributors: Anas Barakat, Bilal Mouhib

Kaggle-like data challenge where the task was to do "acoustic scene classification". In particular, given an audio signal of ~30 seconds, the goal was to find its "context" or the "environment" corresponding to the signal such as a beach, a restaurant, or a metro station. In total we considered 15 different classes and 1170 audio files separated in training, validation and testing sets.

Final solution proposed: 

- Extraction of MFCC and delta MFCC features from the audio files. 
- Combination of early and late fusion to build the design matrix. 
- Scaling matrixes
- Majority vote combining MLP, QDA and Random Forest predictions for the final prediction.
